                <h3>IPL 2021 Qualifier 1, DC vs CSK: Delhi Capitals pacers a worry for experienced Chennai Super Kings</h3>
                <p>Capitals pace attack will make them favourites in 1st Qualifier against CSK

                    It's time for the final sprint. For a while now, we have known that Delhi Capitals 
                    and Chennai Super Kings are the teams to beat in this year's IPL. Two completely different 
                    teams with separate areas of strength --- Rishabh Pant's DC and MS Dhoni's CSK --- now clash
                    for the third time in the season in the first qualifier. A direct spot in the final is at stake.
                    
                    On the face of it, Capitals seem to hold the aces. They have won both their games against CSK
                    in the league stage and Dhoni's boys are coming into this one on the back of a three-match losing streak, although 
                    all three came after ensuring qualification into the playoffs. CSK, however, aren't exactly bothered by the worrying
                    stats thrown at them. Rather they are looking to rectify the areas where they felt they were not up the mark in the
                    last few games. Suresh Raina, who was dropped for the last two games, may also be back because his back-up Robin Uthappa 
                    hasn't exactly fired.
                    
                    There is a sense of acknowledgement in the CSK camp that DC have the best attack in the tournament. The three pacers ---
                    Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje and Avesh Khan --- have the ability to stifle CSK. The trio, with their burst of pace, 
                    can push the likes of Ruturaj Gaikwad, Ambati Rayudu, Moeen Khan, MS Dhoni or even Ravindra Jadeja to the backfoot 
                    and stop them from freeing their shoulders for the big shots.</p>

                <h3>RCB vs DC Highlights: Bharat hits last ball six to seal seven-wicket win for Bangalore</h3>
                <p>
                    With 19 needed from 12, Anrich Nortje bowled a sensational 19th over, going for just four. RCB needed 15 off Avesh Khan's final over and Bharat took RCB over the line with his unbeaten 52-ball 78. He was ably supported by Glenn Maxwell, who got his fourth fifty in five innings
                    The RCB chase got off to the worst possible start when Nortje removed Devdutt Padikkal and Virat Kohli early. With RCB 11 for 2 after three overs, AB de Villiers was promoted to No. 4. But de Villiers couldn't make the most of the move, falling for a run-a-ball 26 to Axar Patel leaving Bangalore 104 to get from the last 10.

                    With the asking rate climbing past 11, Maxwell was dropped twice, by Shreyas Iyer and Ravichandran Ashwin, off Axar. Meanwhile, No. 3 Bharat reached 50 off 37 as RCB brought the equation down to 46 in 24 balls. Maxwell and Bharat then took 15 and 12 off Rabada and Khan in the 17th and the 18th over respectively.

                    Earlier, Kohli won the toss and inserted Delhi. Maxwell got the new ball, probably to get the better of left-hander Shikhar Dhawan. But the move did not reap the desired results as Dhawan took 15 off his eight balls. Maxwell's three overs in the PowerPlay went for 29.

                    The DC openers did not let the tempo drop after the PowerPlay, going after Yuzvendra Chahal and collecting 20 off his first two overs. RCB's wait for a breakthrough ended in the 11th over when Harshal Patel had Shikhar Dhawan caught. Harshal is now two wickets short of the highest tally for an edition — 32 by Dwayne Bravo (2013).

                    At the other end, Shaw fell two short of his fifty, caught off Chahal. Rishabh Pant followed suit, caught behind off Dan Christian. Shimron Hetmyer and Iyer took 16 off the 15th over — bowled by Christian — with two fours and a maximum to give the innings a necessary impetus. However, RCB kept up the pressure as Mohammed Siraj removed Shreyas for an 18-ball 18. Hetmyer’s 22-ball 29 took his team to a fighting score but it wasn't enough in the end on a night when DC was left to rue squandered chances and sloppy fielding.
